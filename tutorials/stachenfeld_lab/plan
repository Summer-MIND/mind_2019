# agent -- steps, updates

# MF model free learner
#   learn a value function
#   learn an optimal policy in latent space

# latents exploration?

# plots
#   rate of reward

# script
# choose task (A, xy, R)
# choose representation
# plot latents (all states, one latent, or all latents, one state)
# random walk, train learning agent -- should i implement a proper RL agent? maybe no
# diffusion walk, train learning agent
