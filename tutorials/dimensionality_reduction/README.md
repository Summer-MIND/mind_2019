# Dimensionality reduction: Making maps from data
### Tutorial for Methods in Neuroscience at Dartmouth (MIND) 2019

Dimensionality reduction is a generic term for describing any technique which allows you to get a smaller number of variables out of a larger set of variables. This tutorial covers dimensionality reduction techniques useful in psychology and neuroscience, with particular focus on PCA, MDS, UMAP, and PLS regression. 

### Installation

First, if you have not already done so, please install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

Clone this repository to your local machine, and open "dimensionality_reduction.Rmd" with RStudio. From the "Run" dropdown menu in the upper left pane, select "Run All". When the script completes, save the .Rmd file, and then select "Preview" to view the R Notebook. To make changes, edit the code in the .Rmd file, re-run the corresponding code-chunk(s), and then save changes - the preview will update automatically.

Alternatively, a static version of the R Notebook can be viewed directly through your web browser by downloading the file ending in ".nb.html" and then opening it with the browser of your choice. Viewing this version does not require R/RStudio, but changes cannot be made to the code.
